# MIPS-CPU-implementation

The implementation of this project was almost entirely written by Tyler Greer (tgreer812@gmail.com) with some debugging help by Lukas Basse.

The goal of this project was to implement a single cycle MIPS CPU. The requirements of the project can be seen in the various lab pdf's starting with lab 4. The final implementation is the final project pdf. The code in this repo reflects the completely finished project so if you are looking to do the project step by step, not all of the code is necessary. 

The project details and pdf's were created by Penn State University as a project for Computer Engineering 331.

If you would like to try and run this code, make sure the cpu.v file is the top level module. (If that doesn't work, try making the cpu test bench the top level module. However, if I remember correctly cpu.v is what should be top level)
